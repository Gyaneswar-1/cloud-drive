   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up environment variables (You may want to add a `.env` file for storing sensitive data such as your cloud storage credentials):
   `env`
   `MONGO_URI=`

   # cloudinary 
   `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=`
   `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=`
   `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=`
